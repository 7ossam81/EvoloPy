# EvoloPy: An open source nature-inspired optimization toolbox for global optimization in Python

The EvoloPy toolbox provides classical and recent nature-inspired metaheuristic for the global optimization. The list of optimizers that have been implemented includes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Moth Flame Optimization (MFO). The full list of implemented optimizers is available here https://github.com/7ossam81/EvoloPy/wiki/List-of-optimizers

If you like our framework then we would really appreciate **a Star ⭐!**


## Features
- Fourteen nature-inspired metaheuristic optimizers were implemented.
- The implementation uses the fast array manipulation using `NumPy`.
- Matrix support using `SciPy`'s package.
- More optimizers is coming soon.

## New Benchmark Functions
We have added the following benchmark functions:

1. **Ackley Function** - Tests convergence behavior.
2. **Rosenbrock Function** - Evaluates valley-following performance.
3. **Rastrigin Function** - Measures global and local search capabilities.
4. **Griewank Function** - Analyzes algorithm robustness.

These functions are now available for evaluating optimization algorithms in EvoloPy.


## Installation
- Python 3.6 or higher is required.

Run

    pip install -r requirements.txt

(possibly with `sudo`)

This command will install `sklearn`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and other dependencies for you.

- **For Windows**: Please install Anaconda from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which is the leading open data science platform powered by Python.
- **For Ubuntu or Debian (Python 3)**:
  
      sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-scipy liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev libgsl0-dev fftw-dev libglpk-dev libdsdp-dev

## Get the source

Clone the Git repository from GitHub

    git clone https://github.com/7ossam81/EvoloPy.git


## Quick User Guide

EvoloPy toolbox contains twenty three benchmarks (F1-F24). The main file is the optimizer.py, which considered the interface of the toolbox. In the optimizer.py you can setup your experiment by selecting the optimizers, the benchmarks, number of runs, number of iterations, and population size. 
The following is a sample example to use the EvoloPy toolbox.  
Select optimizers from the list of available ones: "SSA","PSO","GA","BAT","FFA","GWO","WOA","MVO","MFO","CS","HHO","SCA","JAYA","DE". For example:
```
optimizer=["SSA","PSO","GA"]  
```

After that, Select benchmark function from the list of available ones: "F1","F2","F3","F4","F5","F6","F7","F8","F9","F10","F11","F12","F13","F14","F15","F16","F17","F18","F19". For example:
```
objectivefunc=["F3","F4"]  
```

Select the number of repetitions for each experiment. To obtain meaningful statistical results, usually 30 independent runs are executed for each algorithm.  For example:
```
NumOfRuns=10  
```
Select general parameters for all optimizers (population size, number of iterations). For example:
```
params = {'PopulationSize' : 30, 'Iterations' : 50}
```
Choose whether to Export the results in different formats. For example:
```
export_flags = {'Export_avg':True, 'Export_details':True, 'Export_convergence':True, 'Export_boxplot':True}
```

Now your experiment is ready to run. Enjoy!
