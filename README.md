###EvoloPy: An open source nature-inspired optimization toolbox for global optimization in Python

The EvoloPy toolbox provides classical and recent nature-inspired metaheuristic for the global optimization. The list of optimizers that have been implemented includes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Moth Flame Optimization (MFO).


##Features
⋅⋅*Five nature-inspired metaheuristic optimizers were implemented.
⋅⋅*The implimentation uses the fast array manipulation using NumPy.
⋅⋅*Matrix support using SciPy's package.
⋅⋅*More optimizers is comming soon.

##Installation
Python 3.xx is requiered.
To use this toolbox, NumPy and SciPy must be installed on your computer. 
Please have a look at their documentation to get them installed.
If you are installing EvoloPy Toolbox onto Windows, please Install Anaconda from here https://www.continuum.io/downloads, which is the leading open data science platform powered by Python.

If you are installing onto Ubuntu or Debian and using Python 3 then this will pull in all the dependencies:
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-scipy liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev libgsl0-dev fftw-dev libglpk-dev libdsdp-dev
